# StandbyCleanerLite

- This minimal alternative was made for those who do not need, want or cannot use the additional parameters, commands of the original application without facing complications of any kind.
- This program was compiled with .NET 3.5 and is console-based. For further information, watch Mike Unboxing's video on this topic.
